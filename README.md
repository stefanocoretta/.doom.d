# Doom Emacs literate configuration

This is the literate configuration of my DOOM emacs set-up.

## Getting started with DOOM emacs

If you are after an absolute-beginner's guide to using emacs, check out the [Getting started](https://github.com/stefanocoretta/.doom.d/wiki/Getting-started-with-DOOM-emacs) wiki page. 

## Custom modes

I wrote two custom modes:

- `praat-script-mode`: syntax highlighting for the Praat scripting language.
- `lexurgy-mode`: syntax highlighting for [Lexurgy](https://www.meamoria.com/lexurgy/html/index.html).

## Quotes for the philosophical mind
